# 8. Projects and Forms
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>By clicking on a project or pressing the form button, we can view the forms of the selected project or the loaded project.</p>
<p>Clicking on a form takes us to its details, either from the menu or by clicking on the detail option.</p>
<p>Types of forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>List</strong>: Entities will be displayed in a datatable format. These can be filtered and sorted. By clicking the + button, a new entity will be added, and clicking on a record will take us to its details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edition</strong>: From a new entry or from the list, we access an editing form. The editing form will be composed based on the needs with interface components: tabs, datatables, datalists, tables, buttons, dates, selects, autocomplete, inputs, radios, etc. Some of them may contain other components.</p>
<p>At the bottom, there will be a toolbar for possible actions that can be performed from the editing form: save, delete, cancel, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
