# 1. What is formulio?
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
Formulio is an application for the development of dynamic forms on Android. The goal is to quickly and easily build applications based on forms by designing the presentation using XML templates and implementing the application logic using JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The application includes interface components to cover most cases that arise when implementing a data collection process. The framework uses a "context" system to access information consistently from different sources (database, files, REST APIs, device information, etc.) and supports automatic binding between entities retrieved from the repository and screen components.
The refresh mechanism between components is based on a reactive mechanism, implemented from dependencies between screen components or between components and contexts.
</p>
<p>
Formulio also includes a configurable background process execution module called jayjobs, which allows defining steps to execute in JSON for tasks such as exporting data, synchronizing data with a remote REST API, etc.
