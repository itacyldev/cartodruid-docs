# 1. Introduction

CartoDruid is an application developed at the <a href="https://www.itacyl.es">Instituto Tecnológico Agrario de Castilla y León (ITACyL)</a>, designed as a support tool for fieldwork. It aims to solve the problem of editing georeferenced information on devices without a data connection.
</p>
<p>
In many rural areas, mobile network coverage is either nonexistent or insufficient for efficient work. CartoDruid addresses this issue by allowing users to view vector and raster layers downloaded onto the device itself, and to create geometries either by drawing directly on the screen or using the GPS.
</p>
<p>
CartoDruid does not require prior GIS knowledge to operate and is easy to configure and use. This makes it accessible for anyone to manage information in the field and later export the recorded data for use in other applications.
